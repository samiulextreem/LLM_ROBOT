In order for NVIDIA to deliver services under this supplement, you agree that: you are responsible for procuring, installing and maintaining all equipment and obtaining all consents for other software and other hardware necessary to operate Omniverse; your failure to deploy a Maintenance, Update or Upgrade available to you as promptly as possible may render the applicable Supported Products non-operable or non-conforming to later documentation provided by NVIDIA; you shall further provide through designated users such information, and/or access to your resources and personnel as NVIDIA may reasonably require for providing services. As examples, as reasonably requested you shall (i) identify the correct version(s) of Omniverse Website, License Portal and/or Supported Products, (ii) provide the documentation and assistance necessary to demonstrate and diagnose each potential Technical Support issue, including providing necessary test cases that NVIDIA can reproduce on a Certified System, (iii) provide remote system access (upon mutual agreement) for NVIDIA to replicate potential Errors, and (iv) provide embedded diagnostic information; When you use Maintenance, Update or Upgrade, access to a new product version does not change the number of authorized licenses you have for Supported Products and you shall discontinue use of the prior version as necessary to maintain your authorized number of licenses; you will appoint as designated users only those of your employees who have reasonably appropriate technical backgrounds and skills. You may remove or replace designated users during the service term with notice to NVIDIA; and you will appoint, at NVIDIA’s request, designated service and engineering contacts for service issue escalations.
